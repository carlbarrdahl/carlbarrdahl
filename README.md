I'm a developer focused on React, TypeScript, and Solidity, specializing in building Web3 projects from zero to one. My work centers on developing grants platforms that empower open-source developers and fund public goods initiatives.
As a full-stack developer, I build with modern technologies like Next.js, Node.js, and smart contracts. 

My recent projects include retroactive public goods funding platforms and decentralized crowdfunding solutions.
