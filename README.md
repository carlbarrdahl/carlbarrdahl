# Resume / CV

As a creative React, TypeScript, and Solidity developer, I specialize in crafting robust digital infrastructure that shapes the future. My recent focus has been on developing grants platforms aimed at funding public goods, bolstering support for open-source developers and projects.

With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I excel in creating seamless, efficient, and impactful digital solutions.

My expertise spans a wide range of technologies including React (Next.js), Node.js, Smart Contracts, and various API integrations, making me a versatile asset to any development team.

I am currently engaged in exciting work with WEST / Gitcoin Labs, bringing fresh ideas and robust solutions to the forefront of the Web3 space.
